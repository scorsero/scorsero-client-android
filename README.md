## About
Scorsero provides a new way of productivity tracking. It can be used as a simple to-do app, but in some small tweaks can be transformed into a powerful machine that can route you to your target.

## Dramatic changes
There'se great list of changes that is specified in SRS. Here's summary of that changes:

- No more users are stupid . Each user knows what he wants and can design process and specify tasks
- Second-priority user interface conceding to functionality
- Functionality prior to usability. Even though usability is necessery, we have to give users full spectr of functionality to cover more use cases

## How it works
![Scorsero workflow](https://github.com/scorsero/scorsero-client-android/blob/master/scorsero_flow.png)
Basically, application will collect your daily routine via scores(tasks), track finished scores and do it continuously while you're using this app as a simple todo app. Next step is to analyze all collected data and specify what do you want to accomplish(e.g increase productivity by 20%), it will give you suggestions based on your targets.
